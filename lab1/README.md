# Lab 1: Java Fundamentals

## Overview

This laboratory exercise introduces core Java programming concepts essential for building robust applications. Students will work with variables, arrays, control structures, and exception handling to develop a strong foundation in Java programming.

## Topics Covered

- **Java Variables**: Data types, declaration, and initialization
- **Arrays**: Creation, manipulation, and traversal
- **Flow Control**: Conditional statements and loop structures
- **Exceptions**: Error handling with try-catch-finally blocks

## Learning Objectives

Upon completion of this laboratory exercise, students will be able to:

1. Declare and initialize variables with appropriate data types
2. Create and manipulate arrays in Java
3. Implement flow control structures (conditionals and loops) to solve programming problems
4. Write robust code using exception handling mechanisms (try, catch, finally blocks)

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of programming concepts
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher installed
- An IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or VS Code with Java extensions)

## Lab Structure

### Part 1: Variables and Data Types

Practice declaring and using primitive data types (`int`, `double`, `boolean`, `char`) and reference types (`String`, objects). Focus on:
- Proper naming conventions
- Type casting and conversion
- Variable scope and lifetime

### Part 2: Arrays

Work with single and multi-dimensional arrays, including:
- Array declaration and initialization
- Accessing and modifying elements
- Common array operations (searching, sorting, traversal)

### Part 3: Flow Control

Implement decision-making and iteration structures:
- **Conditionals**: `if`, `if-else`, `switch` statements
- **Loops**: `for`, `while`, `do-while` loops
- Nested control structures

### Part 4: Exception Handling

Build error-resistant code using:
- `try-catch` blocks for exception handling
- `finally` blocks for cleanup operations
- Common exception types (`NullPointerException`, `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`, `NumberFormatException`)
- Best practices for exception handling

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download the lab repository
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE
3. Review the starter code and TODO comments
4. Complete each section following the instructions
5. Test your code thoroughly before submission

## Submission Guidelines

- Ensure all code compiles without errors
- Include comments explaining your logic
- Test edge cases and handle potential exceptions
- Submit your completed `.java` files according to instructor guidelines

## Resources

- [Oracle Java Documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/)
- [Java Exception Handling Guide](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/exceptions/)
- Course textbook and lecture notes

## Support

If you encounter difficulties:
- Review lecture materials and textbook examples
- Consult with teaching assistants during lab hours
- Attend office hours for additional help
- Collaborate with classmates (while maintaining academic integrity)
